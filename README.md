# NUMBER-GUESSING-GAME

ðŸŽ® Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

This repository contains the source code for a simple yet engaging Number Guessing Game developed in Java using NetBeans IDE 20. The game generates a random number within a specified range, prompts the user to guess the number, and provides real-time feedback on each guess - whether it's correct, too high, or too low. The project incorporates key features such as limited attempts, multiple rounds, and cumulative scoring.
